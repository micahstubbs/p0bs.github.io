The season has been bonkers -- we all know that. But, by way of confirmation, this is the first PremPredict league where everyone's worst team is the same: Leicester City. 

Congratulations therefore go to the tinker man, Kant√©, Mahrez and Vardy. But they should also go to Roger Gathercole, who leads the way in our competition. Somehow, Beth and I are currently also in the money.

Here are the standings:

I'll be in touch again in a few weeks. Until then, all the best ...

PS Here's my code to prove that all is kosher:

```{r thecode, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
```

And, for completeness, here are your team-by-team predictions and each team's latest position in the league:

```{r thepredictions, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=TRUE}

Position <- as.vector(1:20)
clubsOrder <- clubOrder$Team
clubsOrder1 <- as.data.frame(cbind(clubsOrder, Position)) %>% 
  rename(Club = clubsOrder) %>% 
  left_join(dataInput, by = "Club")

datatable(clubsOrder1,
          rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(dom = 't',
                         pageLength = 20,
                         order = list(0, 'asc'),
                         columnDefs = list(list(
            className = 'dt-right', targets = 1))))
```
