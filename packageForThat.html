<h1 class="title toc-ignore">There’s an R package for that</h1>

</div>


<p>Here’s a page that I’ve prepared for an R training course that I’m helping to run at my company.</p>
<p>I’ll show a range of tricks made possible by fairly-simple R. This will include web scaping, text analysis and mapping, to name but a few applications.</p>
<p>I’ll introduce all this with an example that uses data from the recent referendum.</p>
<div id="web-scraping" class="section level2">
<h2>Web scraping</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with the packages:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="kw">library</span>(rmarkdown)        <span class="co"># Generates this html report</span>
<span class="kw">library</span>(knitr)            <span class="co"># Underpins this html report</span>
<span class="kw">library</span>(xml2)             <span class="co"># Scrapes web data</span>
<span class="kw">library</span>(rvest)            <span class="co"># Scrapes web data</span>
<span class="kw">library</span>(tidyr)            <span class="co"># Restructures data</span>
<span class="kw">library</span>(dplyr)            <span class="co"># Provides database functionality</span>
<span class="kw">library</span>(magrittr)         <span class="co"># Enables chaining of commands</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, the web scraping. Note that I’ve dimmed-out the code, so that it can be shown on a static webpage. Instead, I have run the code separately and saved the results as an R Dataset. I then just load this dataset on this page:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span class="co"># webResults &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://ig.ft.com/sites/elections/2016/uk/eu-referendum/&quot;)</span>

<span class="co"># webData &lt;- webResults %&gt;%</span>
<span class="co">#   html_nodes(&quot;td:nth-child(1) , .area-state-3 .hideable&quot;) %&gt;%</span>
<span class="co">#   html_text()</span>

<span class="co"># saveRDS(webData, &quot;webData.rds&quot;)</span>

webData &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">readRDS</span>(<span class="st">&quot;webData.rds&quot;</span>)

<span class="kw">head</span>(webData)</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Boston&quot;        &quot;7,430&quot;         &quot;22,974&quot;        &quot;South Holland&quot;
## [5] &quot;13,074&quot;        &quot;36,423&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="dealing-with-strings" class="section level2">
<h2>Dealing with strings</h2>
<p>R can also manipulate strings so that they make sense. In this example, we have some strings that look like numbers but contain a comma. R helps us to remove that comma:</p>

</div>
<div id="map-and-boundary-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Map and boundary data</h1>
<p>The amount of data and shapefiles on maps is extraordinary. In the UK alone, there are choices aplenty. R helps us to use these maps, so that we can calculate the centre points of each local authority (the areas over which the referendum votes were amalgamated). (To speed-up the code, I’ve also done as before and run the code in advance, saving the RDS, only to load it for this page.)</p>
